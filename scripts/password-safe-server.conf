# Upstart script for a play application that binds to an unprivileged user.
# put this into a file like /etc/init/play.conf
#
# This could be the foundation for pushing play apps to the server using something like git-deploy
# By calling service play stop in the restart command and play-start in the restart command.
#
# Usage:
#   start play
#   stop play
#   restart play
#
# WARNING: This is still beta, I have not tested the respawning functionality, but it should work.
